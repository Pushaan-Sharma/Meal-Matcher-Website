# Meal-Matcher-Website

My project “Meal Matcher website” is about providing the user who wants to know the recipe of foods that can be prepared through a particular item, with a serene experience, through easy to use and visually attractive webpage. This site has an input option of the name of the ingredient. The site then displays a variety of dishes that can be made through that ingredient. Clicking on a particular dish opens up the tab of the dish containing information such as the other ingredients required, recipe to prepare the dish, and also contains the link of the YouTube video on preparing that particular dish. The website is made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and the information related to the recipe of the dish has been called through API from https://www.themealdb.com/api.php.
